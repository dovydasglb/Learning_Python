# Declaring string variables:
x = 'a string'
print(x)
# is the same as:
x = "a string"
print(x)

# Also, double quotation marks can be used to avoid using escape keys:
x = "couldn't use a single quotation mark ' without escape key if used them to declare a string"
print(x)
x = 'this works both ways, i.e. you can use "double quotation marks" within single ones'
print(x)
